**Day 28. Drawing a Tile Map** 
_Video Length (including Q&A): [1h36](https://hero.handmade.network/episode/code/day028/)_ 

(insert intro.md.html here) 

We are in the middle of our game architecture phase, where we are starting to think about how we want this game's code to be structured and how we want it to work. 

One of the big things we emphasized in the previous two days when talking about architecture and how you should think about it is that you don't want to do a lot of pre-planning. With pre-planning, you usually don't have the information you need to make those good decisions; you'll make mistakes that will cost you a lot of time. Usually, it is better to explore first, learn, and then go back and say, "Okay, now that I've learned what this code should look like structurally, I can say definitively, this is the architecture and move forward." We're taking this approach precisely and will continue with it today.

We won't go deep into the weeds yet; we're saving the hardcore rendering notions for when we write the renderer. However, if we need to cover something while putting it on the screen, we'll briefly discuss it. We're trying to make a first pass of the initial game code so we can start to look at how it looks and think about how it will develop from there.

Today, we'll start laying out a basic tile map and a character to navigate it.

------------------------

# Floating Point Color

## Floating-Point vs Integer Colors

Let's get started! We're right here at the beginning of the game. It's a giant open field in front of us! If you run the game, you will notice that this field is very pink; it's not very exciting. You might even get a temptation to clear the screen to black or white instead, but having an intense magenta as a base background has its uses. When we make a little tile map with its little squares and color the squares in, we'll be able to see anywhere we are not filling: the pink will show through.

We also wrote a little function to draw a rectangle on the screen, ensuring it wouldn't crash our game and passing a simple hexadecimal color to it. 

![Figure [x]: Our lone rectangle.](../media/day28/screen-1.gif) 

As discussed during [Day 4][], our bit pattern is `0x AA RR GG BB` (with alpha channel unused). If you're from the web programming world, you should be familiar with this layout, which is `#RRGGBB`. However, you may want to do some operations with these colors. For example, blend one color into another or make it darker or lighter. Because modern processors have much bigger floating-point units than integer units, this sort of math would be faster if done on a floating-point number. 

So, even at these early stages, we want to _think generally_ about colors in a floating-point format (one `float` per Red, Green, and Blue channels) and only "pack" the 32-bit floats into a single 32-bit int for concrete operations: storage, output into the buffer, etc.

!!! Note Why red-green-blue?
    You may wonder why we even have Red, Green, and Blue as our basis for colors. In summary, it has to do with how the human eye functions, and we briefly touch on this in the Subsection [A Bit of Color Theory].

Now, when outputting red color, we can say that since our monitor has a particular maximum brightness, we can encode the darkest red (where no red is output at all) and the brightest red as a range from 0 to 1. The same applies to green and blue values. Adopting this convention makes our math with colors more manageable and effectively converts whatever underlying real value into a _percentage_, making it a dimension-free value we can easily convert afterward.

## Convert `DrawRectangle` to Accept Floating-Point Colors

Having said that, we now want to change our `DrawRectangle` to accept floating-point colors. 

~~~~~~~ C++
internal void
DrawRectangle(game_offscreen_buffer *Buffer,
              f32 RealMinX, f32 RealMinY, f32 RealMaxX, f32 RealMaxY, 
~~~~~~~ C++ delete
              u32 Color)
~~~~~~~ C++ add
              f32 R, f32 G, f32 B)
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.cpp]</file> Changing the signature of `DrawRectangle`.]

We must rebuild our `Color` value inside `DrawRectangle`. To do that, we need to find a way to _pack_ a 32-bit floating-point color value into an 8-bit unsigned int. 

An 8-bit number has 256 possible values, so our 0-1 floating-point number should translate to the 0-255 range. The simplest way would be to write `(u8)R * 255.0f`, but let's make the same rounding we did [last time][day 27], to allow our number to round to max value if it's close enough.

~~~~~~~ C++
if (MaxY > Buffer->Height)
{
    MaxY = Buffer->Height;
}

~~~~~~~ C++ add
u32 Color = (u32)(RoundReal32ToInt32(R * 255.0f)
                  RoundReal32ToInt32(G * 255.0f)
                  RoundReal32ToInt32(B * 255.0f));
~~~~~~~ C++
u8 *Row = // ... 
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.cpp > DrawRectangle]</file> Converting numbers from floating point to integers.]

Now, we need to think about how we will pack the numbers. Similarly to what we did on [Day 4][], we need to do some _bit shifting_ (`<<`) and _bitwise OR_ (`|`) operations to put three 8-bit values into one 32-bit value.

* The bits 24-32 are unused, so we don't need to do anything with them.
* We shift __Red__'s 8 bits by 16 to occupy bits from 16 to 24.
* We shift __Green__'s 8 bits by 8 to occupy bits 8 to 16.
* We don't shift __Blue__'s 8 bits (or, if you prefer, move them by 0) to occupy bits 0 to 8.

************************************
[Figure [x]: Pixel bits shifted in the register.]

Here is how it looks in the code: 

~~~~~~~ C++
if (MaxY > Buffer->Height)
{
    MaxY = Buffer->Height;
}

~~~~~~~ C++ edit
u32 Color = (u32)((RoundReal32ToInt32(R * 255.0f) << 16) | 
                  (RoundReal32ToInt32(G * 255.0f) << 8)  |
                  (RoundReal32ToInt32(B * 255.0f) << 0));
~~~~~~~ C++
u8 *Row = // ... 
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.cpp > DrawRectangle]</file> Packing the RGB values. We don't need to write `<< 0`, doing it here to be explicit.]

This should be it; let's replace the values we're using to call the function:

~~~~~~~ C++ edit
DrawRectangle(Buffer, 0.0f, 0.0f, (f32)Buffer->Width, (f32)Buffer->Height, 1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);
DrawRectangle(Buffer, 10.0f, 10.0f, 30.0f, 30.f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.cpp > GameUpdateAndRender]</file> Using the updated `DrawRectangle`.]

We should see no changes after recompiling, indicating that we refactored everything correctly. So now we can easily modify the red, green, and blue values within the 0-1 range, and our rectangles will change colors accordingly. 

## Introduce `RoundReal32ToUInt32`

We could also get more precise with our rounding operation: instead of getting a signed 32-bit value, we can round to an unsigned value instead: 

~~~~~~~ C++
internal s32
RoundReal32ToInt32(f32 Number)
{
    s32 Result = (s32)(Number + 0.5f);
    return (Result);
}

~~~~~~~ C++ add
internal u32
RoundReal32ToUInt32(f32 Number)
{
    u32 Result = (u32)(Number + 0.5f);
    return (Result);
}
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.cpp]</file> Introducing `RoundReal32ToUInt32`.]

While we might not necessarily need this distinction right now, it might come in handy in the future. In the meantime, let's use it in our `DrawRectangle` function: 

~~~~~~~ C++ edit
u32 Color = ((RoundReal32ToUInt32(R * 255.0f) << 16) | 
             (RoundReal32ToUInt32(G * 255.0f) << 8)  |
             (RoundReal32ToUInt32(B * 255.0f) << 0));
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.cpp > DrawRectangle]</file> Using `RoundReal32ToUInt32`.]

## Noting New Emerging Structures

You might have noticed already that some structures are starting to emerge here. For instance, we're probably not often going to pass a red value by itself. It's going to always come with a green and a blue.

And so, game architecture-wise, you can start to see what we'll eventually do here: make a _struct_ that will capture the concept of Color so that we don't have to keep passing our Rs, Gs, and Bs around. We won't do it yet because, so far, we have only used it in one function. We don't have enough information on what such a structure should and should not contain. 

You should start paying attention to these things, feeling this itch in the back of your head. For example, you might note some operations happening on a color in the future. Maybe someone will try to represent them as `u32`; others will work with the `f32` representation. So we'll be passing a bunch of things together. There are many things to find once you know what to look for. 

Similarly, a rectangle might be another structure you might want to pay attention to. These structures are starting to emerge already, and we haven't even done anything yet! 

# Start the Tile Map

Let's make the most straightforward tile map you can imagine! We'll take a 32-bit value and spread it around a bit. 

## Define the Grid

We want to start with a grid 16 tiles across and 9 down, the same as the HD aspect ratio.

~~~~~~~ C++ add
u32 TileMap[16][9];
~~~~~~~ C++

DrawRectangle(Buffer, 0.0f, 0.0f, (f32)Buffer->Width, (f32)Buffer->Height, 1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);
DrawRectangle(Buffer, 10.0f, 10.0f, 30.0f, 30.f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.cpp > GameUpdateAndRender]</file> Introducing the tile map.]

Maybe it's too big for now, but we can adjust it in the future. 

`TileMap` is an array of arrays of `u32`s, also known as a 2D array or double array. In fact, similarly to what we did [last time][day 27], we want to invert X and Y positions because we want the X values to be packed together. 16 will go sequentially, and 9 will be like row offsets.

~~~~~~~ C++ edit
u32 TileMap[9][16];
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.cpp > GameUpdateAndRender]</file> Putting Y count to be in front of X counts.]

Now, we want to define the values for our simple map right there:

~~~~~~~ C++ edit
u32 TileMap[9][16] = 
~~~~~~~ C++ add
{
    {0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0},
    {0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0},
    {0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0},
    {0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0},
    
    {0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0},
    {0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0},
    {0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0},
    {0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0},
    
    {0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0}
};
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.cpp > GameUpdateAndRender]</file> Defining the values for our tiles.]

Now, let's set some values to the tiles to make sure we're drawing what we want: 

~~~~~~~ C++
u32 TileMap[9][16] = 
~~~~~~~ C++ edit
{
    {0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0,  1, 0, 0, 0,  1, 0, 0, 0},
    {0, 1, 0, 0,  0, 1, 0, 0,  1, 0, 0, 0,  0, 1, 0, 0},
    {0, 1, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0,  1, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 1, 0},
    {0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0,  1, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 1},
    
    {0, 1, 0, 0,  0, 1, 0, 0,  1, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 1, 0},
    {0, 1, 0, 0,  0, 1, 0, 0,  1, 0, 0, 0,  0, 1, 0, 0},
    {0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 1, 0, 0,  1, 0, 0, 0,  1, 0, 0, 0},
    {0, 1, 1, 1,  1, 0, 0, 0,  1, 0, 0, 0,  0, 1, 0, 0},
    
    {0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0,  1, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 1, 0}
};
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.cpp > GameUpdateAndRender]</file> Drawing some patterns.]

This way, we expect the final result will look something like this:

[Figure [x]: Our expected output.]

## Render rectangles

Every number here will represent a type of tile. Eventually, it may be land, water, rock, or whatever. For now, though, we will have colored rectangles depending on the tile type. Let's throw a quick `for` loop after we clear our screen. We can also get rid of our small cyan rectangle.

~~~~~~~ C++
DrawRectangle(Buffer, 0.0f, 0.0f, (f32)Buffer->Width, (f32)Buffer->Height, 1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);
~~~~~~~ C++ add

for(int Row = 0;
        Row < 9;
        ++Row)
{
    for(int Column = 0;
            Column < 16;
            ++Column)
    {
        
    }
}

~~~~~~~ C++ delete
DrawRectangle(Buffer, 10.0f, 10.0f, 30.0f, 30.f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.cpp > GameUpdateAndRender]</file> Iterating over the tiles.]

Inside the double `for` loop, we want to access the tile ID. In the future, the ID might access a sprite or a color. We'll assign shades of gray depending on the ID because we don't have any of that yet.

~~~~~~~ C++
for(int Row = 0; /*...*/)
{
    for(int Column = 0; /*...*/)
    {
~~~~~~~ C++ add
        u32 TileID = TileMap[Row][Column];
        f32 Gray = 0.5f;
        if (TileID == 1)
        {
            Gray = 1.0f;
        }
~~~~~~~ C++
    }
}
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.cpp > GameUpdateAndRender]</file> Differentiating different tiles.]

Then, when we draw the rectangle, we will need some other info: 

* `MinX`: We'll get to it in a second.
* `MinY`: Same; let's leave it aside for a moment.
* `MaxX`: If we know the `MinX`, `MaxX` is the same + tile width
* `MaxY`: If we know the `MinY`, `MaxY` is the same + tile height

We can then pass all of this over to our `DrawRectangle` function. We'll pass our `Gray` value for Red, Green, and Blue.

~~~~~~~ C++
for(int Row = 0; /*...*/)
{
    for(int Column = 0; /*...*/)
    {
        u32 TileID = TileMap[Row][Column];
        f32 Gray = 0.5f;
        if (TileID == 1)
        {
            Gray = 1.0f;
        }
        
~~~~~~~ C++ add
        f32 MinX = ;
        f32 MinY = ;
        f32 MaxX = MinX + TileWidth;
        f32 MaxY = MinY + TileHeight;
        
        DrawRectangle(Buffer, MinX, MinY, MaxX, MaxY, Gray, Gray, Gray);
~~~~~~~ C++
    }
}
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.cpp > GameUpdateAndRender]</file> Defining things we need to draw the rectangle.]

Now, how do we calculate `MinX` and `MinY`? Well, we've got a row value and a column value, so for each row, we're going down by one tile height each time it increments. Which we already know is going to be some value we'll define in a moment. The same logic will apply to `MinX`.

That said, `Row` is an integer, whereas we want a float. So, we need to convert that to a floating point value. Unlike rounding to int, conversion to float is automatic in C, but we still want to be explicit about what's happening in the code. This precaution allows us to avoid weird mistakes and avoid having the compiler not do what we expect it to.

Let's also say we want some base offset that we'll call `UpperLeftX` and `UpperLeftY`:

~~~~~~~ C++
for(int Row = 0; /*...*/)
{
    for(int Column = 0; /*...*/)
    {
        u32 TileID = TileMap[Row][Column];
        f32 Gray = 0.5f;
        if (TileID == 1)
        {
            Gray = 1.0f;
        }
        
~~~~~~~ C++ edit
        f32 MinX = UpperLeftX + ((f32)Column) * TileWidth;
        f32 MinY = UpperLeftY + ((f32)Row) * TileHeight;
~~~~~~~ C++
        f32 MaxX = MinX + TileWidth;
        f32 MaxY = MinY + TileHeight;
        
        DrawRectangle(Buffer, MinX, MinY, MaxX, MaxY, Gray, Gray, Gray);
    }
}
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.cpp > GameUpdateAndRender]</file> Defining `MinX` and `MinY`.]

What's left is to define `UpperLeftX`, `UpperLeftY`, `TileWidth`, and `TileHeight`. We'll do it outside the `for` loop and give them some random numbers, to begin with:

~~~~~~~ C++ add
f32 UpperLeftX = 10;
f32 UpperLeftY = 10;
f32 TileWidth = 100;
f32 TileHeight = 100;

~~~~~~~ C++
for(int Row = 0;
    Row < 9;
    ++Row)
{
    for(int Column = 0;
        Column < 16;
        ++Column)
    {
        u32 TileID = TileMap[Row][Column];
        f32 Gray = 0.5f;
        if (TileID == 1)
        {
            Gray = 1.0f;
        }
        
        f32 MinX = UpperLeftX + ((f32)Column) * TileWidth;
        f32 MinY = UpperLeftY + ((f32)Row) * TileHeight;
        f32 MaxX = MinX + TileWidth;
        f32 MaxY = MinY + TileHeight;
        
        DrawRectangle(Buffer, MinX, MinY, MaxX, MaxY, Gray, Gray, Gray);
    }
}
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.cpp > GameUpdateAndRender]</file> Ready to compile.]

We are ready to compile! Let's see how it looks: 

![Figure [x]: Our first tile map.](../media/day28/screen-2.gif) 

We need to adjust our values if we want the tile map to fit on the screen: 

~~~~~~~ C++ edit
f32 UpperLeftX = 0;
f32 UpperLeftY = 0;
f32 TileWidth = 60;
f32 TileHeight = 60;
~~~~~~~

![Figure [x]: Looks good.](../media/day28/screen-3.gif) 

## Tweaking

There we go! Now, we can modify the tile map values as we want. Let's say we want to create a classic dungeon with walls all around, some obstacles, maybe with the doors in the middle.

~~~~~~~ C++
u32 TileMap[9][16] = 
{
~~~~~~~ C++ edit
    {1, 1, 1, 1,  1, 1, 1, 1,  0, 1, 1, 1,  1, 1, 1, 1},

But now we have a big problem! The doors are not centered. Fortunately, it's easy to fix: we will make the grid width odd. It will require us to make some changes though:

![Figure [x]: Nice and centered.](../media/day28/screen-5.gif) 

You will notice we had to modify `UpperLeftX` to ensure the right wall is visible again. That said, if we wanted to have this "half wall" effect for our rows as well, we'd have to make the row count even (which would bring the vertical doors off-center) or change the tile height (which would stretch the tiles to become rectangles instead of squares).

These questions are why we do exploration; we want to think about all these things up front before making decisions about our tile map size, etc. To solve them, we might study old games; maybe they did different dimensions because the standard aspect ratio was 4:3 before HD TVs became commonplace. It's a good moment to put on your thinking cap and consider all this.

# Getting a Player on the Screen

Given that we have a tile map on the screen, it seems the next logical thing to do is make a little player move around. So, similarly to what we did with our debug code back in the day, we want to add some simple values inside the `GameState` structure. We usually shouldn't be able to modify structures while we're hot-loading, but in this case, it should work. It's a unique case due to our empty `GameState` structure; if you recall, we store `GameState` at the beginning of our memory block, with gigabytes of available memory that follow. 

So, for our player, let's say we'll need to capture the player's X and Y positions in the world:

~~~~~~~ C++
struct game_state
{
~~~~~~~ C++ add
    f32 PlayerX;
    f32 PlayerY;
~~~~~~~ C++
};
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.h]</file> Storing player positions.]

## Game Physics and Player Position

We'll use our `DrawRectangle` function to draw the player. That said, we'll probably need to do some calculations to properly position our rectangle respectfully to the player's position. 

When we say "a player touches a wall" in a 2D world, we usually don't mean the top of their head sprite. Usually, they eclipse the wall a bit, so their actual location is typically more about where their center of gravity projects on the floor.

[Figure [x]: Player in the corner.]

So, when we want to calculate the position of the player's sprite (rectangle for now), we need to position it so that the player's position is at its bottom center. We achieve that by offsetting our `PlayerTop` by half the player's width and `PlayerLeft` by its full height.

[Figure [x]: Drawing player rectangle.]

It will eventually become second nature to you, but if you've never done anything with graphics before, you want to think it through like this a few times. 

## Drawing the Player

Let's start typing those values in. We will draw the player after we draw our tilemap on the screen. For `MinX` and `MinY`, we'll calculate `PlayerLeft` and `PlayerTop`. We'll offset these by player width and height to achieve `MaxX` and `MaxY`.

~~~~~~~ C++
for(int Row = 0; /*...*/)
{
    for(int Column = 0; /*...*/)
    {
        // ...
    }
}

~~~~~~~ C++ add
DrawRectangle(Buffer, PlayerLeft, PlayerTop, 
              PlayerLeft + PlayerWidth, 
              PlayerTop + PlayerHeight, 
              PlayerR, PlayerG, PlayerB);
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.cpp > GameUpdateAndRender]</file> Drawing player rectangle.]

We will need the red, green, and blue values for our color; let's make it a lovely yellow: 

~~~~~~~ C++ add
f32 PlayerR = 1.0f;
f32 PlayerG = 1.0f;
f32 PlayerB = 0.0f;
~~~~~~~ C++

DrawRectangle(Buffer, PlayerLeft, PlayerTop, 
              PlayerLeft + PlayerWidth, 
              PlayerTop + PlayerHeight, 
              PlayerR, PlayerG, PlayerB);
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.cpp > GameUpdateAndRender]</file> Defining player color.]

The tile width and height will determine the player's width and height. Maybe we'll make the width slightly smaller to pass through doors more easily:

~~~~~~~ C++
f32 PlayerR = 1.0f;
f32 PlayerG = 1.0f;
f32 PlayerB = 0.0f;
~~~~~~~ C++ add
f32 PlayerWidth = 0.75f * TileWidth;
f32 PlayerHeight = TileHeight;
~~~~~~~ C++

DrawRectangle(Buffer, PlayerLeft, PlayerTop, 
              PlayerLeft + PlayerWidth, 
              PlayerTop + PlayerHeight, 
              PlayerR, PlayerG, PlayerB);
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.cpp > GameUpdateAndRender]</file> Setting player width and height.]

Finally, to calculate `PlayerLeft`, we take `PlayerX` and remove half of `PlayerWidth`, as we said. Instead of dividing by `2`, we'll multiply by `0.5f` as it's more efficient. For `PlayerTop`, we'll take `PlayerY` and subtract the entire `PlayerHeight`:

~~~~~~~ C++
f32 PlayerR = 1.0f;
f32 PlayerG = 1.0f;
f32 PlayerB = 0.0f;
f32 PlayerWidth = 0.75f * TileWidth;
f32 PlayerHeight = TileHeight;
~~~~~~~ C++ add
f32 PlayerLeft = GameState->PlayerX - (0.5f * PlayerWidth);
f32 PlayerTop = GameState->PlayerY + PlayerHeight;
~~~~~~~ C++

DrawRectangle(Buffer, PlayerLeft, PlayerTop, 
              PlayerLeft + PlayerWidth, 
              PlayerTop + PlayerHeight, 
              PlayerR, PlayerG, PlayerB);
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.cpp > GameUpdateAndRender]</file> Setting player width and height.]

## Player Movement

We can now compile, but we won't see any changes: since both `PlayerX` and `PlayerY` are zero, we draw the whole player rectangle outside the top-left corner of our screen. Let's add some simple code to control player movement (keyboard-only, for the time being).

The logic is straightforward: we define delta values for X and Y and then add them to the player's X and Y. 

~~~~~~~ C++
game_controller_input *Controller = GetController(Input, ControllerIndex);
if (Controller->IsAnalog)
{
    // NOTE(casey): Use analog movement tuning
}
else
{
    // NOTE(casey): Use digital movement tuning
~~~~~~~ C++ add
    f32 dPlayerX = 0.0f;
    f32 dPlayerY = 0.0f;
    
    GameState->PlayerX += dPlayerX;
    GameState->PlayerY += dPlayerY;
~~~~~~~ C++
}
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.cpp > GameUpdateAndRender]</file> Setting up player input.]

These delta values change if we press the corresponding keys.

~~~~~~~ C++
    f32 dPlayerX = 0.0f;
    f32 dPlayerY = 0.0f;
~~~~~~~ C++ add
    
    if(Controller->MoveRight.EndedDown)
    {
        dPlayerX = 1.0f;
    }
    if(Controller->MoveLeft.EndedDown)
    {
        dPlayerX = -1.0f;
    }
    if(Controller->MoveDown.EndedDown)
    {
        dPlayerY = 1.0f;
    }
    if(Controller->MoveUp.EndedDown)
    {
        dPlayerY = -1.0f;
    }
    
~~~~~~~ C++
    GameState->PlayerX += dPlayerX;
    GameState->PlayerY += dPlayerY;
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.cpp > GameUpdateAndRender]</file> Processing player input.]

We have our dude, and he's moving around now! He moves around pretty slowly, and that's fine; we're not in a rush. Let's see, however, what's causing it and how we can change that.

## Frame-independent Character Movement

What we wrote above is quite simple, but what does it mean? Every frame we press a button, say the `D` key, our player moves by 1 pixel to the right. In other words, we move our player by one pixel for every game frame. 

There are many reasons why this is not ideal. If our framerate is faster, the player will move faster; if it's slower, the player will move slower. Some games did it in the past, and on modern hardware, it's almost impossible to experience them as they run dozens, if not hundreds, of frames per second faster than they were designed for. 

Instead, let's apply the frame time we got last time, stored in `SecondsToAdvanceOverUpdate`. In fact, this is a bulky name, let's rename it to something like `dtForFrame`:

~~~~~~~ C++ 
struct game_input
{
    game_button_state MouseButtons[5];
    s32 MouseX, MouseY, MouseZ;
    
~~~~~~~ C++ edit
    f32 dtForFrame;
~~~~~~~ C++ 
    game_controller_input Controllers[5];
};
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.h]</file>]

~~~~~~~ C++ 
while (GlobalRunning)
{
~~~~~~~ C++ edit
    NewInput->dtForFrame = TargetSecondsPerFrame;
~~~~~~~ C++ 
    // ... 
};
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[win32_handmade.cpp > WinMain]</file> Renaming `SecondsToAdvanceOverUpdate` to `dtForFrame`.]

We can use `dtForFrame` by multiplying it with our `dPlayerX` and `dPlayerY`:

~~~~~~~ C++
    if(Controller->MoveUp.EndedDown)
    {
        dPlayerY = -1.0f;
    }
    
~~~~~~~ C++ edit
    GameState->PlayerX += Input->dtForFrame * dPlayerX;
    GameState->PlayerY += Input->dtForFrame * dPlayerY;
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.cpp > GameUpdateAndRender]</file> Using real frame time.]

This solution works, but you'll notice that the player is now moving at a glacial pace. let's speed things up a bit by adding another multiplier:

~~~~~~~ C++
    if(Controller->MoveUp.EndedDown)
    {
        dPlayerY = -1.0f;
    }
    
~~~~~~~ C++ add
    dPlayerX *= 64.0f;
    dPlayerY *= 64.0f;
~~~~~~~ C++ edit

    GameState->PlayerX += Input->dtForFrame * dPlayerX;
    GameState->PlayerY += Input->dtForFrame * dPlayerY;
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.cpp > GameUpdateAndRender]</file> Using real frame time.]

# Recap 

All we've written so far is just exploratory code. At this point, anything goes. Ignore the code quality, errors, performance, or anything else! The goal of exploration is to see what you would type in if you just had to do the thing fast, in our case, draw a tile map on the screen. That is the only thing that you should be worrying about. At this point, you should never give even a moment's thought to anything you see in those books, like writing clean code or effective C++. We should shut off all of this because we want to know what the CPU should do to achieve what we want, at least some notion of the final code. The next step will be to review what we wrote and figure out the clean way to make it. 

We're going to start having an actual game here. We have so much stuff to discuss, from renderer to coordinate systems (because we don't want to be in pixels as we progress). We have tons of stuff to do, explain, and investigate in detail. The game won't be up and running anytime soon, yet it's so fun to have a little thing moving around on a tile map. Pretty soon, our game will be kind of playable: a little rectangle dude running around between tile maps and fighting little rectangle monsters! 

Anyone gets excited about a bunch of beautiful sprites flying around on the screen and doing stuff that's not hard to get excited about. It's when you're excited about the little things it says something about where your inclinations lie.

# Side Considerations 

## A Bit of Color Theory

Light is a type of radiation visible to a human eye. Any electromagnetic radiation consists of waves oscillating at varying speeds, and the _cone cells_ in our eyes can capture three separate ranges that roughly correspond to red, green, and blue light. (The ranges vary by person and age, so providing an exact definition is impossible.) Because these ranges overlap, our eyes can perceive various colors by combining these three "primary" colors.

![Figure [x]: Average spectra of human cone cells.](../media/day28/eye-spectrum.svg) 

Similarly, you can take any three colors or properties of a color and create a _[Color space][]_. You can thus arrive at the _[color models][]_ describing a color in three or four values, such as: 

* __RGB__: describes how much Red, Green, and Blue light needs to be _emitted_ to produce a given color. Adding all three at maximum produces white.

![Figure [x]: RGB Color model.](../media/day28/rgb-additive.gif) 

* __CMY__ (or __CMYK__): used in paint or print to indicate how much Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow produce colors on a white sheet or canvas. Adding all three at maximum produces black.

* __HSL__: Describes the color in terms of Hue, Saturation, and Lightness, where lightness goes from black to white, with base color in the middle.

![Figure [x]: HSL Color model, represented on a cylinder.](../media/day28/hsl-cylinder.png) 

* __HSV__: Similar to HSL, it describes the color in terms of Hue and Saturation but replaces Lightness with Value (black to maximum chromaticity).

![Figure [x]: HSV Color model.](../media/day28/hsv-cylinder.png) 

If you go a bit deeper and describe that color space mathematically, you can arrive at specific color _[gamut][]s_. These are then used as standards for hardware production or general usage. If you pick the colors closer to the primary human eye colors, you get a broader range of the colors that a device can output (printer or display) or perceive (camera or scanner).

![Figure [x]: sRGB Color Gamut provided specifications for the displays in the late 90s and is the current web colorspace.](../media/day28/srgb-gamut.png) 

Modern consumer screens use arrays of LEDs that emit different strengths of red, green, and blue light to mix the colors. When these arrays are dense enough, we can't tell the difference and accept the mixed colors they produce.

![Figure [x]: Modern LED screen under a microscope.](../media/day28/amoled-screen.jpg) 

As programmers, we _generally_ don't need to represent the colors in any "better" way than RGB. There are exceptions to this when we do our computations; if we go for high photorealism, it may be necessary to simulate the actual wavelength of the light as opposed to its RGB value. But it's always true regarding the output of the actual pixels on a physical screen, i.e., when we want to render a computed image. We can produce any colors in the respective gamut by adjusting the intensity of red, green, and blue pixel components.
