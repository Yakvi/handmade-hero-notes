We did quite a bit of theory last time; let's get to practice! 

# Project State Space

If we put on our fantasy hats and head into the fantasy land of unicorns, magic, and Project State Space, we will find a map showing our progress on the project. In our case, we're essentially at Day 0 of the project (if you exclude the excruciating need of having to talk to Windows), and our map looks quite empty:

*                    \You are here.                  *
******************************************************

But in that imaginary land, there's a point when we will ship our project:

******************************************************

*                                                    *
*                                                    *

*                                                    *
*                                                    *
*            Day 0 *                                 *

[Figure [x]: You are still down there.]

Of course, if you worked on any project, you know that the path from start to finish is _never_ straight. It's even more the case in the wonderful world of software development. This path to victory is often arduous, full of deviations and even setbacks: 

******************************************************
*          Day 700? * <----- Ship                    *
*                   ^           .---.                *
*                   |          |     |               *
*                    '--------'      |               *
*          .------------------------'                *
*         /         .--------.                       *
*        /         /          |                      *
*       |         /           |                      *
*        '-------'    .------'                       *
*                    /                               *
*                   /                                *
*                  |                                 *
*            Day 0 *                                 *
******************************************************
[Figure [x]: This is a map of a good project. It gets to ship.]

Often, you don't even know how the final product will look! You only have a vague idea, but unless it's anything more complex than a "hello world" project, any additional details will be revealed as the project grows stronger. It's not even necessarily a "point" that you're trying to reach, but more of a nebulous blob of possibilities that slowly condenses into the final product.

So how should one approach this voyage, sitting down for the new day and hoping it will bring the project (or even individual pieces of code) closer to the finish?
