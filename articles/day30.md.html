**Day 30. Moving Between Tile Maps** 
_Video Length (including Q&A): [1h55](https://hero.handmade.network/episode/code/day030/)_ 

(insert intro.md.html here) 

For the past few days, we've been trying to imagine what our game will do so we can begin work on our engine. It's a bit of a paradox: we can't make a game without a game engine, but we can't make a game engine without understanding our game. That's why we're playing with the test code!

We're in the middle of making a rudimentary way of transitioning between rooms. The code we're typing is awful, but we aren't doing it for demonstration purposes only; it's a legitimate way to develop good architecture. It's not a good idea to write clean code at this point; you will always have time to clean it up later. 

# Expand World Definition

Last time, we implemented basic collision for our tilemap and started thinking about transitioning between rooms. We introduced the concept of "worlds" but have not worked with them yet. 

We also started drafting the `IsWorldPointEmpty` function. In it, we thought we'd need the `TileMapX` and `TileMapY` on top of the existing pixel X and Y coordinates. We probably want to store these coordinates in the game state always to know in which world the player was in the last frame:

~~~~~~~ C++
struct game_state
{
~~~~~~~ C++ add
    s32 PlayerTileMapX;
    s32 PlayerTileMapY;
~~~~~~~ C++
    
    f32 PlayerX;
    f32 PlayerY;
};
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.h]</file> Storing player tile coordinates.]

At the beginning of a new frame, we thus want to retrieve information about the _current_ tile map instead of the tile map 00. We also want to move the player width and height definition further up so that it's a "fixed" value. 

~~~~~~~ C++
TileMaps[0][0].UpperLeftX = -30;
TileMaps[0][0].UpperLeftY = 0;
TileMaps[0][0].TileWidth = 60;
TileMaps[0][0].TileHeight = 60;

~~~~~~~ C++ add
f32 PlayerWidth = 0.75f * TileMaps[0][0].TileWidth;
f32 PlayerHeight = TileMaps[0][0].TileHeight;
~~~~~~~ C++

TileMaps[0][0].Tiles = (u32 *)Tiles00;

TileMaps[0][1] = TileMaps[0][0];
TileMaps[0][1].Tiles = (u32 *)Tiles01;

TileMaps[1][0] = TileMaps[0][0];
TileMaps[1][0].Tiles = (u32 *)Tiles10;

TileMaps[1][1] = TileMaps[0][0];
TileMaps[1][1].Tiles = (u32 *)Tiles11;

~~~~~~~ C++ edit
tile_map *TileMap = &TileMaps[GameState->PlayerTileMapY][GameState->PlayerTileMapX];
~~~~~~~ C++

world World;
World.TileMapCountX = 2;
World.TileMapCountY = 2;
World.TileMaps = (tile_map *)TileMaps;

~~~~~~~ C++ delete
f32 PlayerWidth = 0.75f * TileMap->TileWidth;
f32 PlayerHeight = TileMap->TileHeight;
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.cpp > GameUpdateAndRender]</file> Retrieving current tile map.]

Even better, we have our `GetTileMap` function that we can use to retrieve a tile map. It helps us avoid mistakes (like forgetting to invert X and Y coordinates to access the array), adds bounds checking, and allows us to rework this functionality in the future.

We also need to move this step to after the initializing the game state; otherwise, we won't be able to access it.

~~~~~~~ C++ delete
tile_map *TileMap = &TileMaps[GameState->PlayerTileMapY][GameState->PlayerTileMapX];
~~~~~~~ C++

world World;
World.TileMapCountX = 2;
World.TileMapCountY = 2;
World.TileMaps = (tile_map *)TileMaps;

game_state *GameState = (game_state*)Memory->PermanentStorage;
if(!Memory->IsInitialized)
{
    GameState->PlayerX = 150;
    GameState->PlayerY = 150;
    
    Memory->IsInitialized = true;
}

~~~~~~~ C++ add
tile_map *TileMap = GetTileMap(&World, GameState->PlayerTileMapX, GameState->PlayerTileMapY);
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.cpp > GameUpdateAndRender]</file> Using a helper function instead.]

## Assertions

We will _assert_ that the player's location is valid, as we don't want the player to wander too far into the void. If you recall, we introduced Assertions on day 14 but haven't used them much until now. We mainly used them to ensure our Win32 audio code wasn't too crazy. 

The assertions will help us avoid blindsiding as we push into unfamiliar territories. Consider these as inline unit tests if you're more familiar with them. 

In our case, the game will simply crash when an assertion fails, allowing us to go up the stack trace and verify what went wrong. If we fill the code with assertions enough, we'll be able to catch bugs long before we stop thinking about this or that part of the code.

~~~~~~~ C++
tile_map *TileMap = GetTileMap(&World, GameState->PlayerTileMapX, GameState->PlayerTileMapY);
~~~~~~~ C++ add
Assert(TileMap);
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.cpp > GameUpdateAndRender]</file> Asserting the tile map exists.]

## Rethinking `IsWorldPointEmpty`

Last time, we quickly drafted a function to check whether we would transition to another tile map. 

~~~~~~~ C++
internal b32
IsWorldPointEmpty(world *World, s32 TileMapX, s32 TileMapY, f32 TestX, f32 TestY)
{
    b32 Empty = false;
    
    tile_map *TileMap = GetTileMap(World, TileMapX, TileMapY);
    if(TileMap)
    {
        Empty = IsTileMapPointEmpty(TileMap, TestX, TestY);
    }
    
    return (Empty);
}
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[handmade.cpp]</file> IsWorldPointEmpty.]

This function doesn't currently do anything interesting: it just fetches a tile map and evaluates if its point is valid. Let's think about what it should do instead.

Imagine a simple situation where our player goes through a door on the left. By doing so, they'd be traversing the tile map boundary:

[Figure [x]: Walking through the doors is easy, we're told.]

If we map this onto the tile map coordinates, we can see that we want to go from a tile map X position of 1 to a new one of -1:

*********************************************************
*-----+------+------+------+------+------+------+------ *
* -4  |  -3  |  -2  |  -1  |  0   |   1  |   2  |   3   *

*********************************************************
[Figure [x]: From the current tile map's perspective, we're going negative.]

Until now, we'd assume a position of -1 to be blocked. What we want to do instead is to ask the tile map on the left whether its _right-most_ tile is occupied. Let's assume that each tile map is $n$-wide: 

*********************************************************

*...----------------------' '------------------------...*

*********************************************************
[Figure [x]: We don't want to transition tile maps if we hit a wall on the other side.]

You can easily see how the tiles on the left would map to the right tilemap's space: tile $n-1$ would become $-1$, $n-2 \rightarrow -2$, $n-3 \rightarrow -3$, and so forth. The opposite is true for the tiles right-most from a tilemap:
