**Handmade Hero Notes**

Welcome to Handmade Hero! This is a series where we program an entire game, from scratch, with detailed explanations of each each step. 

!!! Tip
    Over the years, a whole community has spawned around the project. Head over to [Handmade Network][hmn] if you have any question, comment or feedback!

    Additionally, if you preorder [Handmade Hero][], you will receive access to the GitHub repository, containing complete source code (tagged day-by-day) as well as community ports to other platforms. If you get stuck somewhere during this course, be sure to check it out! 

Keep in mind that everything we're going to show you in this course is only _one way_ of coding a game from scratch. It is not the only way, and you don't have to follow each step the same manner it is presented here. In this course, we will present you how [Casey][] makes games, so that you can see one __complete way__ of doing it, where nothing is left out. You are encouraged however to develop your own techniques and experiment with your own styles, try different things and see what works best for you.
