(##) Special call outs

You will see many special call outs spread around the page. These are made both to break the text down and to insert some variety into it. Aside from pictures, code, tables and graphs, you will find the following: 

!!! Note Note

!!! Warning Warning 
    This is an important thing to note. Read this part very carefully.

As for the code blocks, these would have the following markings:

~~~~~~~ C++

/* This is also a comment for C/C++ code, 
   it can go on multiple lines */
This is a line which was already present in the code (introduced earlier)
and remains without a change. Or it is a new code block entirely.
~~~~~~~ C++ delete
This is a deleted line.
~~~~~~~ C++ add
