**Day 3. Allocating a Back Buffer**
_Video Length: [1h03](https://hero.handmade.network/episode/code/day003/) (before Q&A)_

(insert intro.md.html here)

We have not quite finished setting up our application: some things need to be cleaned up, and we need to start drawing to our window. 

Today, we'll need to create something that would become our _buffer_ of pixels that we can write to in any way that we want. We then need to give it back to Windows, so that it displays it in our window for us. It won't be necessarily the most _efficient_ way of render things on Windows (nowadays everything goes through the 3D graphics card). However, before anything can go to the graphics card, we're going to do everything from scratch ourselves, so we'll need to follow a slightly slower path. 

!!! Trivia
    This is _sort of_ going back to the old days, when this was _the_ way of writing renderer. At the time there simply wasn't much in a way of graphics card to do for you. It was simply in charge of displaying the graphics buffer on the screen. 

# Windows Message Callback

In the previous chapter, we finished setting up our window and getting ready of outputting something into it. We have our _callback function_ and a _message loop_. The latter is a way to process the _message queue_, where Windows and other programs add messages. We need to _pull_ these messages, one at a time, Translate and Dispatch them, so that they are sent to our `MainWindowCallback` function. 

!!! Note Why do we need a callback function at all? 
    We have our message queue which we pull messages from, why can't we process them at the same place, without going through setting up an opacque message dispatch system? 

    While we're those who pull the messages from our queue, we aren't the only ones who can call our callback function. Windows reserves the right to call that callback function any time it wants to. It does not have to do it inside that `DispatchMessageA`, and we have to be ready for the operating system to call us back. 

## Closing the Window

In our `MainWindowCallback`, we left out a couple of things to fix. One thing is that you cannot close it without interrupting the process from the debugger (`Shift-F5`) or the Task Manager. The reason for it is that we are not currently handling `WM_CLOSE` message (aside from printing `WM_CLOSE` to Output whenever we hit it). 

To handle `WM_CLOSE` message properly there're a few things that we can do. 

First, let's look at our message loop inside the `WinMain`. As you might remember from the [previous chapter](day2.html#createwindow/windowmessagequeue), if `GetMessage` receives `WM_QUIT` message, its result is `0` (and if the window handle provided is invalid, the result is `-1`). That is why we're checking if the message result is greater than `0`: 

~~~~~~~ C++
for(;;)
{
    MSG Message;
    BOOL MessageResult = GetMessage(&Message, 0, 0, 0);
    if (MessageResult > 0)
    {
        TranslateMessage(&Message);
        DispatchMessage(&Message);
    }
    else
    {
        break;                      
    }
}
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[win32_handmade.cpp > WinMain]</file> Our message loop.]

So, at the moment, if we want to exit the application, we simply need to receive a quit messsage! Luckily there's a [handy function][PostQuitMessage] that does just that:

~~~~~~~ C++
case WM_CLOSE:
{
    ~~~~~~~ C++ add 
    PostQuitMessage(0);
    ~~~~~~~ C++
    OutputDebugStringA("WM_CLOSE\n");
} break;
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[win32_handmade.cpp > MainWindowCallback]</file> Requesting `WM_QUIT` message from `WM_CLOSE`.]

The `0` that we pass to the `PostQuitMessage` is our _exit code_. As in our `WinMain`, this simply means "all good, program terminated correctly". In case of some error, you could use some other number so that you're able to analyze why your program might have crashed. We don't really care about this because we won't see much interaction with Windows. 

!!! Warning
    This is your daily reminder to lookup the function names in `MSDN` yourself! While we're providing all the functions and extract the important bits out of them, this course might not have all the calls that you might need for your own programs. 

    Be sure also to make sure the articles you find are for your target architecture. You can check it in the **Requirements** section at the bottom of each article where you can see some useful information like "Minimum supported client". You can also find here other useful information like the library (that we used already a couple of times).

Let's compile and debug our program.

1. Set up a breakpoint at the `WM_CLOSE` case in your `MainWindowCallback` and at the message loop `break` point (`F9`).
2. Start debugging (`F5`).
3. Hit the red `X` button in your window. You will notice that your program halts at the breakpoint you've set. 
4. Hit `F10` to advance the program until `PostQuitMessage`. This function will then trigger and post a new `WM_QUIT` message to the queue.
5. Continue running the program (`F5`). 
6. One of the new messages that we receive with our `GetMessage` will be `WM_QUIT` which will trigger the breakpoint at our `break` statement.
7. `F10` -> `break` will throw us out of the message loop.
8. If you hit `F10` a couple more times, the program will reach its end and exit.

!!!
    Keep in mind that `WM_QUIT` might not come immediately after `WM_CLOSE`. Usually there would be a plethora of other messages the queue should go through before it gets to `WM_QUIT`.

![Figure [x]: Hitting our breakpoint to exit the loop. Notice that this happens (shortly) after we have processed `WM_CLOSE` message, as the `Output` line states.](../media/day3/quit1.png)

If you're wondering out why aren't we closing our window, check out subsection [About Resource Handling].

There's a bit of an oddity in that we are handling the `WM_CLOSE` message but not the `WM_DESTROY`. If you want to write a bit _cleaner_ code, you may also add the same `PostQuitMessage` to `WM_DESTROY`:

~~~~~~~ C++
case WM_DESTROY:
{
    ~~~~~~~ C++ add 
    PostQuitMessage(0);
    ~~~~~~~ C++
    OutputDebugStringA("WM_DESTROY\n");
} break;
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[win32_handmade.cpp > MainWindowCallback]</file> Requesting `WM_QUIT` message from `WM_DESTROY`.]

If you want to go even one step further to tidy everything up, you could [destroy the window][DestroyWindow] (and from there quit): 

~~~~~~~ C++
case WM_CLOSE:
{
    ~~~~~~~ C++ edit
    DestroyWindow(Window);
    ~~~~~~~ C++
    OutputDebugStringA("WM_CLOSE\n");
} break;
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[win32_handmade.cpp > MainWindowCallback]</file> Requesting `WM_DESTROY` message from `WM_CLOSE`.]

In reality, we aren't going to do any of these things. We will introduce a _global variable_ that, if set to false, will lead us out of the game loop.

This brings to us the following chain of changes:

1. Inside `WinMain`, what used to be an infinite `for` loop becomes a `while` loop (from "forever" it will become "while we are running").
2. As the criteria for the `while` loop, we will use a global boolean variable called `Running` that we will create on top of our `win32_handmade.cpp` file. 
    * In the future, this variable might be moved somewhere else, but it will be global for now. 
3. Inside our `WM_CLOSE` case of `MainWindowCallback`, we will set it to `false`. This means that, whenever we receive a `WM_CLOSE` message, user wants to quit -> stop running -> go out of the `while` loop and exit our application. We can add the same line in `WM_DESTROY` for consistency. In a grand scheme of things, this is a temporary measure. In the final game there're a few considerations against such a solution:
    * We might not want the user to close the application right away, but maybe spawn a confirmation dialogue before switching off the game loop.
    * In another case, we might not expect the window to be destroyed; in that case we might treat it as an error of some sort and try to recreate the window.
4. Set `Running` to true just before entering the `while` loop.

In total, this will result in the following set of changes:

~~~~~~~ C++
#include <windows.h>

~~~~~~~ C++ add
static bool Running;
~~~~~~~ C++

LRESULT CALLBACK
MainWindowCallback(...)
{
    switch (Message)
    {
        case WM_CLOSE:
        {
~~~~~~~ C++ add
            Running = false;
~~~~~~~ C++
        } break;
        
        case WM_DESTROY:
        {
~~~~~~~ C++ add
            Running = false;
~~~~~~~ C++
        } break;
        // ... 
    }
    // ...
}

int CALLBACK
WinMain(...)
{
    //... 
    if (Window) {
~~~~~~~ C++ add
        Running = true;
~~~~~~~ C++ edit
        while (Running) // Replaces "for" loop
~~~~~~~ C++
        {
            //...
        }
    }
}

# Different Meanings of `static`

Let's make a small detour here. 

We [already encountered](day2.html#drawingsomethingtoourwindow/“animating”thewindow) the `static` keyword. We mentioned that `static` has three meanings in C, depending on where you put it (we used it to identify a "locally persistent" variable inside our `WM_PAINT`), so let's define it as three different keywords. We'll add them at the top of `win32_handmade.cpp`: 

~~~~~~~ C++
#include <windows.h>

~~~~~~~ C++ add
#define internal static 
#define local_persist static 
#define global_variable static 
~~~~~~~ C++
// the rest of our program
~~~~~~~ 

!!! Note
    Learn more about the `#define` in the subsection [Define Directive].
    
In our case, we `#define` three different names to translate as the `static` keyword. Let's look in which situations to use which.

## global_variable

`global_variable` is a variable that, once declared, is available in the entirety of the file it's in. Any function can access it, read its value and modify it. 

Additionally, any `global_variable`, once declared, is initialized to `0`. 

Before we move on, let's rename our `static bool Running` into a `global_variable`: 

~~~~~~~ C++
#include <windows.h>

#define internal static 
#define local_persist static 
#define global_variable static 

~~~~~~~ C++ edit
global_variable bool Running;
~~~~~~~ C++
// the rest of our program
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[win32_handmade.cpp]</file> Renaming `static` Running]

!!! Note About Global Variables
    You can read some additional consideration about the global variables in the subsection [About Global Variables].

## local_persist

Locally persistent `static` variable stays around similar to a `global_variable` but it's locally scoped.This is the way we used it [last time](day2.html#drawingsomethingtoourwindow/“animating”thewindow). 

Normally, whenever you enter a _scope_, area designated by braces (`{}`), variables declared inside it live until you go out of it. Then that memory is cleared, variable becomes undefined and, if there was already a variable with the same name declared further "above", the latter's value is returned to the variable.

~~~~~~~ C++
int x = 0;
{ // enter scope
    int x = 1; 
    int y = 2; 

    printf(x); // 1
    printf(y); // 2
} // exit scope

printf(x); // 0
printf(y); // compilation error: y is undefined

~~~~~~~
[<file>[Example 1]</file>. Redaclaring a variable will also produce a warning on a higher warning level.]

If you mark a variable with `static` (or, in our case, `local_persist`), it will be declared only once for the whole duration of the program. Each time that your program returns to that point (in a loop, or by calling the function multiple times), the application will remember the variable's value from the last time it was at this point in the program.

~~~~~~~ C++
int GetNextNumber()
{
    int Result = 0;
    int x = -1;

    {
        static int x = 0; 
        x = x + 1;
        Result = x;
    }

    return (Result);
}

int main()
{
    printf(GetNextNumber()); // 1
    printf(GetNextNumber()); // 2
    printf(GetNextNumber()); // 3
    printf(GetNextNumber()); // 4
}
~~~~~~~
[<file>[Example 2]</file>. Note that this wouldn't change the variable's scope, it will still be only available inside its block.]

In <file>example 2</file>, inner `x` is initialized to 1 only once. The rest of the times, when we call our `GetNextNumber` function, it "remembers" its value from the last time, and correctly increments itself by 1.

While we're at it, let's rename our only `static` variable to `local_persist`.

~~~~~~~ C++
case WM_PAINT: 
{
    // ...
    ~~~~~~~ C++ edit
    local_persist DWORD Operation = WHITENESS;
    ~~~~~~~ C++
    PatBlt(DeviceContext, X, Y, Width, Height, Operation);

    EndPaint(Window, &Paint);
}
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[win32_handmade.cpp > MainWindowCallback]</file> Renaming `static` Operation.]

!!! Warning Don't use `local_persist` in your final code!
    There're many reasons to _never_ use static variables in the final code. This is a very bad idea for thread safety and other advanced things. 
    
    It was one of the reasons we even split the `static` keyword into three keywords: so that we can search for `local_persist` variables and strip them away from the final code.
    
    However, they are a handy tool for development purposes, because they allow to quickly introduce something to the code without having to worry about passing things around, and this is exactly what we are doing right now in `WM_PAINT`: making sure our `PatBlt` does exactly what we want to it to do.     

## internal

If a `static` keyword is applied to a function, the function is marked as "internal" to that specific file, and no one from outside may access it.

!!!
    Actually, the locality may extend to more than one file, i.e. to the entire _translation unit_ of the program. We'll speak about the translation units much, much later down the line. 

# Lay Out the Plan

## Backbuffer, Windows, GDI and Us

Now that we've got that out of the way, let's compile and run our program. If you still can see your window, which you can close correctly, you succeeded in this _refactoring_. We initialize our `Running` to `true` which keeps the `while` loop running, until we hit a `WM_CLOSE` message. At that point `Running` becomes `false`, we fall out the `while` loop and Windows cleans up the program for us, whether we like it or not.

We fixed the only problem with our application that we had: that we couldn't close it. We can close it now! _Very exciting_. We could handle now the `WM_SIZE` and `WM_ACTIVATEAPP` which we left out as stubs. But the real problem right now is that we can't paint anything meaningful. There a few considerations here:

* When we had to do our paint, we had to use Windows' graphics API called "GDI". This makes heavy use of a lot of instruments like Device Contexts, Brushes, `PAINTSTRUCT`s, etc.
* Since we want to do everything from scratch, we want to interface with GDI as little as possible. In practice, we will use it only pass a bitmap to display in our window.
    - Think of a bitmap as simply a picture. It's literally a _bit map_, a sequence of colors: Red, Green, Blue, Red, Green, Blue, etc[^bitmap].
* The bitmap itself would be created (rendered) using our own code and techniques. 
* To create the bitmap, we need to ask Windows to _allocate_ (prepare and assign to us) a _memory buffer_ (a block of memory) that we can write into. 
    - We need to ask for the memory because we can't simply create a variable with many _bits_ and write into it: for very big memory blocks (like our buffer) you need to _allocate memory_ (or reserve it for our use).
    - Also we need to ask for it because Windows (or any other good operating system) is very protective of the memory its applications use.
    - We will then arrange it in a format that Windows is comfortable with us handing back to it.

## Create / Resize DIB Section 

In practice, we are going to introduce the function called `ResizeDIBSection`. It will serve to reisze (or initialize if it doesn't exist) a <b>Device</b> <b>Indipendent</b> <b>Bitmap</b> (DIB). This is the name Windows gives to the bitmaps that we can display using GDI. We will call it every time we get a `WM_SIZE` message. 

~~~~~~~ C++
global_variable bool Running;

~~~~~~~ C++ add
internal void
ResizeDIBSection()
{
}
~~~~~~~ C++

LRESULT CALLBACK
MainWindowCallback(...)
{
    LRESULT Result;
    
    switch (Message)
    {
        case WM_SIZE:
        {
~~~~~~~ C++ add
            ResizeDIBSection();
~~~~~~~ C++
            OutputDebugStringA("WM_SIZE\n");
        } break;
        
        // ...
    }

    return(Result);
}
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[win32_handmade.cpp]</file> `ResizeDIBSection` is created.]

## Calculate Client Area

A key piece of information that we will need to resize our buffer is the size of our window's _client area_, i.e. the area which we can draw into (it's smaller than the actual window area)[^fullscreen]. The Windows API function responsible for it is called simply `GetClientRect`. Take a moment to find it on MSDN!

----------

As you can see, this function takes a window handle and a _pointer_ to a RECT structure. Windows will write the size of our window to this struct. This will give us the top, left, bottom and right coordinates that we will need to convert to width and height like we did when we were doing our `PatBlt`. 

We will then pass these values to our `ResizeDIBSection`.

~~~~~~~ C++
internal void
~~~~~~~ C++ edit
ResizeDIBSection(int Width, int Height)
~~~~~~~ C++
{
}

// ...
        case WM_SIZE:
        {
~~~~~~~ C++ add
            RECT ClientRect;
            GetClientRect(Window, &ClientRect);
            int Width = ClientRect.right - ClientRect.left;
            int Height = ClientRect.bottom - ClientRect.top;
~~~~~~~ C++ edit
            ResizeDIBSection(Width, Height);
~~~~~~~ C++ delete
            OutputDebugStringA("WM_SIZE\n");
~~~~~~~ C++
        } break;
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[win32_handmade.cpp]</file> Calculating client area size]

## Some Refactoring

Before we move on, let's do some cleaning up. Because we're operating on a Windows platform at the moment, you might incur in the naming conflicts. We will simply add a `Win32` prefix our functions to indicate the platform we're on.

~~~~~~~ C++
internal void
~~~~~~~ C++ edit
Win32ResizeDIBSection(int Width, int Height)
~~~~~~~ C++

LRESULT CALLBACK
~~~~~~~ C++ edit
Win32MainWindowsCallback(...)
~~~~~~~ C++
{
    // ...
    case WM_SIZE:
    {
        // ...
~~~~~~~ C++ edit
        Win32ResizeDIBSection(Width, Height);
~~~~~~~ C++
        // ...
    }
}

int CALLBACK
WinMain (...) // WinMain remains with the old name since Windows _expects_ WinMain function
{
    WNDMCLASS WindowClass = {};
~~~~~~~ C++ edit
    WindowClass.lpfnWndProc = Win32MainWindowCallback;
~~~~~~~ C++
    // ...
}
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[win32_handmade.cpp]</file> Adding `Win32` Prefix]

If you prefer, you could introduce a `namespace` around the code instead.

## Update Window

We now have our buffer. Each frame, we will redraw it using the procedures that we'll write. After that, the buffer will be `PAINT`ed into the window. To do that, we will ask Windows to do a copy of our buffer into a space occupied by our window inside `WM_PAINT`. 

!!!
    In order to create smooth animation, we will be forcing Windows to redraw at a specific framerate (30/60+ frames per second). This means that at some point we will need to also paint in our main loop, outside of `WM_PAINT`. But we'll get there later.

Let's introduce a function which we will call `Win32UpdateWindow`. For this function to work, we can imagine we'll need the device context and the client rect (`X, Y, Width` and `Height` we calculated). We then can call it in our `WM_PAINT`. Let's also remove all the temporary code used for `PatBlt`:

~~~~~~~ C++
internal void
Win32ResizeDIBSection(int Width, int Height)
{
}
~~~~~~~ C++ add
internal void
Win32UpdateWindow(HDC DeviceContext, int X, int Y, int Width, int Height)
{
}
~~~~~~~ C++

// Win32MainWindowCalback
    // ...
    case WM_PAINT:
    {
        PAINTSTRUCT Paint;
        HDC DeviceContext = BeginPaint(Window, &Paint);

        int X = Paint.rcPaint.left;
        int Y = Paint.rcPaint.top;
        int Width = Paint.rcPaint.right - Paint.rcPaint.left;
        int Height = Paint.rcPaint.bottom - Paint.rcPaint.top;
~~~~~~~ C++ delete
        local_persist DWORD Operation = WHITENESS;
        if (Operation == WHITENESS)
        {
            Operation = BLACKNESS;
        }
        else
        {
            Operation = WHITENESS;
        }
        PatBlt(DeviceContext, X, Y, Width, Height, Operation);
~~~~~~~ C++ add
        Win32UpdateWindow(DeviceContext, X, Y, Width, Height);

        EndPaint(Window, &Paint);
~~~~~~~ C++
    }break;
    // ...
~~~~~~~

# Implement Logic

We now have 2 functions: `Win32ResizeDIBSection` and `Win32UpdateWindow`. But they don't do anything yet. Let's fix that: we know that one will be necessary to create or resize our DIB section, while the other will be used to output our buffer to window. We also have a rough idea what they should take.

A quick research on MSDN (using words as `Create`, `DIB`, etc.) leads us to two functions: [CreateDIBSection][] and [StretchDIBits][]. Let's start from the latter, and make our way to the former.

## `StretchDIBits` Implementation

`StretchDIBits` is a rectangle-to-rectangle image copy. If the destination rectangle is bigger, the image is increased, if not, shrunk down. 

!!! Tip
    Look up the function syntax on MSDN! If you can't find it, use [this link][StretchDIBits].

As you can see, the function takes quite a few parameters, but most of them are pretty straightforward.

* `HDC`: handle to our device context. Just pass it in.
* `xDest, yDext, DestWidth, DestHeight`: These are the four parameters that we just got from our client `rect`. Again, just pass them in.
* `xSrc, ySrc, SrcWidth, SrcHeight`: These are the same parameters but for our source rectangle. For today it's the same exact rectangle as the client `rect`.
* `*lpBits` and `*lpbmi`: We can skip these for now.
* `iUsage`: specified what kind of buffer is passed (whether it's palettized or RBG). We'll use `DIB_RGB_COLORS`. 
* `rop`: raster operation code. This code allows to specify what do we want to do with the destination on bitwise level. We only want to copy from `Src`, so let's use `SRCCOPY` constant.

~~~~~~~ C++
internal void
Win32UpdateWindow(HDC DeviceContext, int X, int Y, int Width, int Height)
{
~~~~~~~ C++ add
    StretchDIBits(DeviceContext, 
                  X, Y, Width, Height,
                  X, Y, Width, Height,
                  const VOID       *lpBits, // TODO!
                  const BITMAPINFO *lpbmi,  // TODO!
                  DIB_RGB_COLORS, SRCCOPY);    
~~~~~~~ C++
}
~~~~~~~
[Listing [x]: <file>[win32_handmade.cpp > Win32UpdateWindow]</file> Filling out `StretchDIBits`.]

We don't really care about the return of this function. If it succeeds, it returns a non-zero value, so we could in theory capture it to ensure it went smoothly. We leave this as an excercise for the reader.

!!! Note RGB and Palette colors
    ![Figure [x]: Color cop.](../media/day3/colorcop.png)
    We assume that you have knowledge of how the RGB values work in computers. If you bring up a color picking utility, you will see that each color (in RGB mode) has a Red, Green and Blue component, each represented by a number from 0 to 255. 
    
    This is what's intended under RBG color mode. Each pixel is represented by a Red byte, a Green byte and a Blue byte per each pixel drawn.
    
    A Palette however is when you want to be more indirect (and potentially save buffer memory). For example, if you want to have 16 colors total in your image (from 0 to 15), in your buffer you will write just numbers, from 0 to 15, and have a "palette" passed somewhere together with your buffer, where each index has its corresponding RGB color. This is how, for example, a GIF image works, or "Posterize" effect in Photoshop.
    
    On the topic of color-picking utilities, we highly recommend one called [Color Cop][]. It's a lightweight utility which allows you to pick any color on the screen

To conclude, we now miss the bitmap info and the actual buffer. And to get those, we need to go back to `Win32ResizeDIBSection` and `CreateDIBSection`.

## `CreateDIBSection` Implementation

Now, `CreateDIBSection`, the main call inside `Win32ResizeDIBSection`, may be even less straightforward than the `StretchDIBits` we just saw. 

From the get-go, we can fill out a few parameters:
* `hdc`: Device Context, we'll get back to it.
* `*pbmi`: a pointer to a BITMAPINFO struct that we will need to fill out.
* `usage`: same thing as `iUsage` we've just seen, `DIB_RGB_COLORS`.
* `**ppvBits`: a pointer to a `void` pointer.
    * It simply means that Windows will need an address of a `void *`. 
    * This `void *` will contain the address to our `BitmapMemory`, the reason for why we actually started this whole enterprise.
        * To read more about the `void *`, check out void Type subsection.
* `hSection`: As you can see from its description in MSDN, this is something we need to specify if we want to get fancy with our DIB section. We just need the memory, so `0` is fine.
* `offset`: An offset referencing the `hSection` above. We'll also leave it at `0`. 

We will also make use of the handle that this function returns, so let's capture it, as well. 

~~~~~~~ C++
internal void
Win32ResizeDIBSection(int Width, int Height)
{

!!! Note Returning More Than One Value in C
    Sometimes, you want a function to return more than one value. For instance, `CreateDIBSection` returns the bitmap handle but also a pointer to the bitmap memory. But, in C, you can only _return_ one thing. How would such a problem solved? 
        * One way would be to create a "return variable" before calling a function, and pass its _address_. The function would then overwrite whatever value there was with the return value. This is how most of Windows API is implemented.
        * Another way would be packaging all the data in a custom "response" struct. If we were to implement CreateDIBSection, we might have a similar API as a result: 

    ~~~~~~~ C++
    struct create_dib_section_result
    {
        HBITMAP Handle;
        void *Memory;
    };
    create_dib_section_result CreateDIBSection(DeviceContext, BitmapInfo, usage, etc, etc2);
    ~~~~~~~

    Of course, this might potentially create some issues if you return more than a few values, but then you'd need to re-evaluate if your function doesn't do too much work anyway. Additionally, this is a more recent way; before C was standardized in 1989, you could not return structs, so some older API still linger in the old ways before of legacy compatibility.

### Fill Out `BITMAPINFO`

The next thing that we are going to tackle is the `BitmapInfo`, a `BITMAPINFO` structure which we need to pass a pointer to. This is the structure which, at first, will be filled out by us. 

If you open the structure on [MSDN][BITMAPINFO] you will notice that it has only two components. That's not that bad, right? And we can safely ignore the `bmiColors` array as it's only relevant if we're in the Palette mode (which we are not).

However, if you open [documentation][BITMAPINFOHEADER] for the `BITMAPINFOHEADER` structure you will be presented a more familiar wall of text. 

~~~~~~~ C++
typedef struct tagBITMAPINFOHEADER {
  DWORD biSize;
  LONG  biWidth;
  LONG  biHeight;
  WORD  biPlanes;
  WORD  biBitCount;
  DWORD biCompression;
  DWORD biSizeImage;
  LONG  biXPelsPerMeter;
  LONG  biYPelsPerMeter;
  DWORD biClrUsed;
  DWORD biClrImportant;
} BITMAPINFOHEADER, *PBITMAPINFOHEADER;
~~~~~~~
[<file>[MSDN]</file> `BITMAPINFOHEADER` structure syntax.]

We can fill it out directly by referencing it directly via the `BitmapInfo.bmiHeader` as follows: 

* `biSize`: Size of the `bmiHeader` structure. We can easily calculate it by using a handy `sizeof` function.
* `biWidth, biHeight`: Width and Height of our DIB section
* `biPlanes`: This is an obsolete value which by now should always be `1`. 
    * In the past, it was used when multiple chunks of memory were combined to get the required color. 
* `biBitCount`: How many _bits per pixel_ we will use. We will have 3 bytes of color (1 for Red, Green an Blue channels), so each byte being 8 bits, we'd need 24 of them... but we'll ask for `32` for the reasons which will become clearer later down the line (spoiler: it has to do with alignment). 
* `biCompression`: What type of compression we want. Since we don't want our image to be compressed at all (we want the fastest thing possible), we indicate `BI_RGB`.

We don't care about the remaining parameters, so let's just _clear to zero_ the whole struct upon initialization.

~~~~~~~ C++ edit
BITMAPINFO BitmapInfo = {};
~~~~~~~ C++ add
BitmapInfo.bmiHeader.biSize = sizeof(BitmapInfo.bmiHeader);
BitmapInfo.bmiHeader.biWidth = Width;
BitmapInfo.bmiHeader.biHeight = Height;
BitmapInfo.bmiHeader.biPlanes = 1;
BitmapInfo.bmiHeader.biBitCount = 32;
BitmapInfo.bmiHeader.biCompression = BI_RGB;
~~~~~~~ C++

void *BitmapMemory;

HBITMAP BitmapHandle = CreateDIBSection(DeviceContext,       // TODO
~~~~~~~ C++ edit
                                        &BitmapInfo,
~~~~~~~ C++
                                        DIB_RGB_COLORS,       
                                        &BitmapMemory, 
                                        0, 0);

### Decide on Memory Allocation

Now, let's remember that we will allocate a **new** buffer each time that we resize our window. This can potentially be very bad as our application could explode in memory consumption very quickly if we aren't careful. We need to free the memory that we're getting. Now here comes a dilemma: 

* We could try and free a DIB section each time before we create a new DIB section, or
* We can wait and see if we can get a new DIB section first, and if we can't, try to free an already existing one. 

Both scenarios are not ideal, but let's go for the first one. We're running a risk to find no BitmapMemory to free to begin with (and we can therefore crash), but it's still better than potentially creating memory leaks. Plus we can "bulletproof" this later.

~~~~~~~ C++ add
// TODO(casey): Bulletproof this.
// Maybe don't free first, free after, then free first if that fails.

// TODO(casey): Free our DIBSection
~~~~~~~ C++
BITMAPINFO BitmapInfo = {};
// ...
void *BitmapMemory;

HBITMAP BitmapHandle = CreateDIBSection(DeviceContext,       // TODO
                                        &BitmapInfo,
                                        DIB_RGB_COLORS,       
                                        &BitmapMemory, 
                                        0, 0);
