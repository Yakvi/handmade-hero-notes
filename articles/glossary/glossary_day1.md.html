* [Bit Field][] is a sequence of bits, usually stored as an `unsigned int` of a known length. It's used to read and write individual bits using [bitwise OR][bOR] and specific constants. 
* [Bitwise operators][bitwise] operate on one or more bit patterns or binary numerals at the level of their individual bits. It is a fast and simple action, directly supported by the processor, and is used to manipulate values for comparisons and calculations. 
* [Bitwise OR][bOR] is a binary operation that takes two bit patterns of equal length and performs the logical inclusive OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result in each position is 0 if both bits are 0, while otherwise the result is 1.
