(##) About the Notes and the Code Blocks

You will see many special call outs spread around the page. These are made both to break the text down and to insert some variety into it. Aside from pictures, code, tables and graphs, you will find the following: 

!!! Note Note
    This is a note.

!!! Warning Warning 
    This is an important thing to note. Read this part very carefully.

!!! Tip Tip
    This is a useful tip.

!!! Trivia Trivia
    This is an interesting fact or some historical trivia.

As for the code blocks, these would have the following markings:

~~~~~~~ C++
// This is a comment for C/C++ code chunks
This is a line which was already present in the code (introduced earlier)
and remains without a change.
~~~~~~~ C++ delete
This is a deleted line.
~~~~~~~ C++ add
This is a new line.
~~~~~~~ C++ edit
This is a previously existing line which was edited.
