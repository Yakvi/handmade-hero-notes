**Day 12. Platform-Independent Sound Output** 
_Video Length (including Q&A): [1h37](https://hero.handmade.network/episode/code/day012/)_ 

(insert intro.md.html here) 

Last time, we mainly covered the theory: the basics of the platform API design. We talked about the ability of abstract your code away, so that it's not tied to the operative system. We talked about writing mainly code that's used across all the platforms the game ships on, while using only a small thin layer that allows the game to run on said platforms. Ultimately, the complexity and efficiency of such an API boils down to how well you define the boundary between the platform-specific and the platform-independent code. 

Today we're going to continue the transition towards platform-independent code that we started after we've gone through all that theory.
