Welcome to "Handmade Hero Notes", the book where we follow the footsteps of [Handmade Hero][] in making the complete game from scratch, with no external libraries. If you'd like to follow along, preorder the game on [handmadehero.org][handmade hero], and you will receive access to the GitHub repository, containing complete source code (tagged day-by-day) as well as a variety of other useful resources.
