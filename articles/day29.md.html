_Video Length (including Q&A): [1h39](https://hero.handmade.network/episode/code/day029/)_ 

(insert intro.md.html here) 

------------------------
<!-- 

2:30 Review of what's currently been done
3:17 Clearing the screen to black and offsetting the drawable area
6:49 Player collision with the tilemap
17:23 Moving player initial position inside the map
20:31 Clearing only the parts of the screen not drawn on
23:10 Function for checking if a point is occupied and tile_map struct
27:05 Accessing tilemap data as 1-dimensional array
35:16 Adding player width to the collision
37:50 Making player change the map when walking through a door
43:56 About storing all tilemaps in one big structure
50:28 Start on storing and accessing multiple tilemaps and the world struct
1:01:00 Short recap on where we are

1:02:16 Q&A
1:03:10 John Blow points out we haven't initialised the world struct members
1:03:43 Question: Why does player sometimes stop a pixel before the wall?
1:14:36 Question: Are your variables for tilemaps too similar to each other or am I just easily confused?
1:16:12 Question: Is there an advantage on using bool32 instead of using bool 8-bit?
1:17:07 Question: Can you go over briefly how to encode the tile data in a single uint32?
1:17:55 Question: Why does left and right side collision work but not the top and bottom?
1:20:43 Question: Why save TileWidth and Height if those values never change?
1:21:02 Question: What are the differences between structs and classes?
1:23:14 Question: Do you always put int32 or can you use only int?
1:24:45 Question: So int32 is because you want to make the game for 32bit computers?
1:26:05 The player moves faster diagonally than it's supposed to. Are you planning on fixing that?
1:27:10 Question: I'm not familiar with #define, what is it used for?
1:28:34 Question: When you use int32 does it have a different influence on the code than normal ints?
1:30:05 Making the platform header C compliant
