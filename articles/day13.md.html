_Video Length (including Q&A): [1h33](https://hero.handmade.network/episode/code/day013/)_ 

(insert intro.md.html here) 

We're in the middle of taking our Windows code and turning it into platform-independent code with just a little Windows layer. This will set us up to success to allow to go to lots of platforms, without having to touch the code in the main game. 

Last time, we moved the sound over the API "boundary". In this chapter, we're going to do the same thing with the input system.
